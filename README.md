## Good Habits

 - obtain files from my **stat430sp25** repo before class starts
 - use your computer's terminal, it is less user-friendly but it is MUCH faster
 - Stay centered and remember Hofstadter's Law, which describes the widely experienced difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. **Hofstadter's Law**: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
 

## Lab Hints

 - can work on labs in small groups of 2-3
 - get a jump start on the labs, do not wait until the last minute
 - use caching when appropriate
 - make sure that your lab report compiles when you complete a problem or stop working for the day
 - push often
 - do not jeopardize the entire lab over one problem

### Course Information

This is a reading, seminar, and project based course on the intersection of baseball, statistics, and data science. In this course you will learn how to conduct relevant data analyses with a focus on how to quantify and visualize aspects of baseball play associated with winning games. You will also learn about the statistical history of baseball with an emphasis on comparing players across eras. Founding principles, intensive data analysis, and advanced statistical methods will be discussed for both directions. The analyses that you conduct will also develop your coding ability and critical thinking skills as a statistician and data scientist. Furthermore, practical advantages, limitations, and comparisons of methods will be discussed. If you are interested in quantifying how good Mike Trout is or in ranking the careers of Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, and Babe Ruth, then this is the course for you.  

**Prerequisites**: STAT 385 or equivalent experience with R, STAT 425, and STAT 410.  Familiarity with Git and GitHub is helpful, but not required.



### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to conduct methodologically strong data analyses that can answer questions of scientific interest, specifically the students will: 
 
  - Analyze and investigate databases of baseball statistics 
  
  - Utilize and understand procedures for quantifying success in baseball
  
  - Develop a solid practical understanding of procedures which compare players across eras
  
  - Develop data processing and visualization skills
  
  - Critique estimation procedures and modeling development strategies
  
  - Apply version control software and develop reproducible technical reports

### Grading Breakdown

| category | notes | points
| :-- | :---- | :---- |
| Attendance | 5 points each course; 4 free misses  | 125 points
| Labs | 100 points each | 500 points
| Final Project | 50 points for approved project; 75 points for presentation (recorded summary); 250 for project materials and writeup | 375 points
| total | | 1000 points


I will be using a +/- grading schema. The grade distributions will be: 

| Lower bound | Upper bound | Letter grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 980 | 1000 | A+ |
| 933 | 979 | A |
| 900 | 932 | A- |
| 867 | 899 | B+ |
| 833 | 866 | B |
| 800 | 832 | B-|
and so on 


#### Attendance and Course Content

Attendance will be a course requirement. There will be 29 lectures and you will receive 5 points for each lecture you attend, up to 125 points. Thus you are allowed to miss up to 4 lectures with no penalty.  There will be a signup sheet that is distributed at the beginning of class, you need to sign your name to verify your presence in class. Let your instructor know in advance if you cannot attend any class. Everyone on the course roster will receive attendance points for the first day of class. 


#### Labs

There are 5 labs total. Labs will be worth 100 points unless otherwise noted. When completing the assignment, read it carefully, and follow the directions. These labs can be completed in groups of 2-3 students. Every group member will submit their own lab report. Make sure to list your collaborators in your lab report.

For each lab assignment, you will submit two files - .Rmd and .html (or .pdf) - saving your files with your name and lab assignment number. **The lab naming convention is netid_lab#**.  For a student with netid *abc123* that is submitting lab4 files, their files would be saved as *abc123_lab4.Rmd* and *abc123_lab4.html* (or *abc123_lab4.pdf*). **Failure to adopt this lab naming convention will result in point deductions and headaches.**  Make sure your lab is professional and reproducible containing only relevant derivations, code, results, and explanations. **Questions about the grading should be directed to the TA**. 

**Students must use GitHub to start, finish, and submit their labs. More details will be discussed in class.**

Labs should be stored in a lab# directory in your GitHub repo that is a sub directory of a labs directory in your GitHub repo. For example, your fourth homework assignment should be saved in the directory 

```
labs/lab4/
```

within your personal GitHub repo.  Failure to do this will result in point deductions.

**Late lab submissions will be accepted with a penalty.** There will be a 20 point deduction if a lab is submitted 48 hours after the deadline. Labs submitted later than 48 hours after the deadline will not be considered.


**New Compiled Output Policy**

If you do not submit a compiled PDF or HTML file within three days after the deadline, 50 points will be deducted from your score. This penalty will be lifted once you submit the compiled output, but a 5-point late penalty will apply. If you do not submit the compiled file within three days, your lab will not be graded, and your score will remain a 50.

This policy is separate from the late submission policy, which applies when no files have been uploaded to GitHub by the deadline.


#### Project

This course will have a final project instead of an exam. This will be a group project comprised of 2-3 students. Final projects for this course will be fairly open-ended and not subject to a one-size-fits all standard. That being said, all projects need instructor approval. 

Details and project rubrics are TBD.

Possible projects include: 

  - Writing a report on an interesting player. This can a player past or present, and the reason that said player is interesting can vary from being successful in a newly understood analytic, possessing great underlying metrics which should translate to future great performances, or a HOF argument for a controversial candidate who you think has a misunderstood case.
  
  - Estimate the value of different players (possibly hypothetical players).  For example, who is more valuable: a pitcher who pitchers 200 innings with a 4.75 ERA or a pitcher who pitches 125 innings with a 3.50 ERA?
  
  - Examine interesting batter-pitcher matchups concerning one particular player or a few players.
  
  - Estimate marginal handedness-stadium specific spray chart distributions.

  - Development of a new performance metric, or a combination of metrics, which you can argue is valuable. Examples include expected "x" stats based on Statcast data.
  
  - Development of a player or team projection system, or a comparison of projection systems.
  
  - Creation of an era-adjusted JAWS-type statistic to rank players' careers.
  
  - Era-adjusting statistics that do not yet exist on the current version of the Era-Adjustment App. Examples include: SB/CS, WHIP and its inputs, and SLG and its inputs.
  
  - An investigation into the existence of *clutch* which includes matchup information.
  
  - Creating a Shiny app that does something interesting.
  
  - Develop a "causal" WAR stat computes the difference in team winning percentage when a player is available vs when the player is not available.
  
  - Something else!


#### Exams

There will be no exams!

### Course Communication

We will use several forms of communication for this course. The website will be the one-stop-shop for all course information. Course announcements will be sent via email. Be sure you are regularly checking your `@illinois.edu` email account.

If you would like to communicate with the course staff, our preferred methods of communication, in order, are:

1. Office Hours
2. Discussion Forum (Ed) 
3. Email

Email should largely be reserved for private matters. As much as possible, we would appreciate you asking questions about the course where we can respond so that other students benefit from your questions! It's cliche to say, but if you have a question, someone else is probably thinking it!

### Office Hours

For Spring 2025, all office hours will be held **online** via Zoom as seen above. Time listed are Champaign local time. The office hour schedule is always subject to change, but the times above are the general expectation. As such, the dates and times will be posted each week along with the course materials.

Office hours are by far our preferred forum for discussing individual specific questions. In office hours, our response time will be literally instant. Also, since we are both present in the same physical location (or together on Zoom), follow-up is both expected, and easy. Using asynchronous forms of communication such as the discussion forum or email will have a slower response rate and a much lower communication bandwidth. In other words, please come to office hours!

When joining office hours, be prepared to share your screen! Assuming you are having a technical or coding issue, the easiest way for us to assist is for you to **show** us the problem.

Office hours will be a rather informal meeting. As such, if the instructor and a student are engaged in causal conversation not directly related to a pressing matter in STAT 430, like a homework question, please just jump into the conversation and interrupt! If office hours are "busy" the instructor may institute an informal queuing system, but the hope is to keep office hours more relaxed and informal.

If you would like to schedule a private meeting outside of regular office hours, please send an email suggesting two possible times, on two different days (a total of four suggested times). We have a preference for time-slots directly adjacent to current office hours. *Please also indicate a brief agenda for the meeting.* Requests to schedule a meeting at a time less than 24 hours in the future are unlikely to be granted.


#### Discussion Forum

This course will use [**Ed**](https://edstem.org/) as our discussion forum. Here is the link to join: https://edstem.org/us/join/n72aTq

Ed access and login information was sent via email.

Please register your account with your University email (accounts registered with an email other than an `@illinois.edu` account will be removed).

I generally check Ed within a day or two after it alerts me that a new topic has been posted. Thus you can often expect a response within three or so business days. If you need a quicker response, you should consider office hours as an alternative.


The course staff would strongly prefer the use of Ed to GroupMe or similar services not officially supported by the course. The course staff feels that a GroupMe may exclude members of the course, whereas all are welcome on Ed. Services like GroupMe also exclude course staff, which while understandable, tends to promote an adversarial relationship between students and their instructors. **We're all on the same team, so let's act like it.**


Private posts have been disabled. Any private matters should be discussed over email where your identity is known and private. Some anonymous posting is disabled. You may post anonymously to your classmates, but not the course staff.


#### Code Discussion

If your question is technical in nature, there are several steps you can take to insure a speedy response. 

First and foremost, you should ask Google before you ask the course staff. Take the error message you obtained and search it with Google. The ability to solve problems this way is an extremely value skill, possibly one of the most important you should learn (but are not taught) during your academic career. Make a legitimate effort to solve the problem on your own. You won’t always be able to, and if you can’t, post on Ed. (Or consider stopping by office hours.)

If you need to ask the course staff, include the following in your discussion forum post:

-  **All** code that is required to re-create the error.
  - Staff should be able to run your code, without any modification, and obtain the same error or output.
- The exact error message received.


Do not only use screenshots of code and error messages to communicate about them. Copy paste them so that others can copy-paste them as well. Posts containing screenshots of code will likely be deleted.


**In this course, for everything expect final projects, we greatly prefer over-sharing to under-sharing code. We would rather everyone learn from others' "mistakes" than have everyone experience the same issues over and over again.**

### Policies

#### Disability Accommodations
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-1970, e-mail disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website.  If you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, you can talk with someone at the Counseling Center, McKinley Mental Health, or DRES about how to see a provider in order to obtain a diagnosis or get your questions answered.

#### Academic Integrity
It is expected that all students abide by the campus regulations on academic integrity [http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html].  Intentional violations of academic integrity can be found at http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-402.html and include, but are not limited to, copying any part of another student's homework, allowing another student to copy any part of your homework, or submitting a review or summary of a presentation not attended.



#### For Your Safety
We have been asked by Public Safety https://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/run-hide-fight/ to share the following information in case of weather or security emergencies. See the links:

- [Emergency Response Recommendations](https://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/run-hide-fight/)
- [Video on Emergency Response](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_bbti3ec5)

#### Sexual Misconduct Policy and Reporting
The University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University's Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options. 

A list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found at https://wecare.illinois.edu/resources/students/#confidential. Other information about resources and reporting is available at https://wecare.illinois.edu.
