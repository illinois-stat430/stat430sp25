## Miscellanea

Here is a loose collection of fun content related to baseball analytics: 

1. The movie Moneyball (2011) featuring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill presents the story of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane's quest to build a baseball team using baseball analytics back when baseball analytics were foreign to the mainstream baseball world. [Here's a good clip from the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzin1DgexlE). We'll cover some of the contents from this clip in our class.

2. Brian Kenney debates Ken "Hawk" Harrelson in a [equal parts hilarious and frustrating video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXYvc1JGcgo) which contrasts the new school analytics vs the old school "the will to win". 

3. [Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould) discusses a paradox between baseball statistics and baseball talent in a [very profound 5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNM6ait4LOc). This video is based off of a chapter of Gould's book [Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin](https://www.amazon.com/Full-House-Spread-Excellence-Darwin/dp/B09W89Z8FY?crid=3VTWFD50DQ2ZA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m7kAqExmq-ilYLk1I8al1CXDw7h1UyuI-t_jmgRB3Ug3lBwMk4QXd3wSgPL69g4EuLJ7SEDIPl2IH9HblOgIDaWXAWuPhtHWUVgzNxAHXRjm3PK4dRLuAcqX-iJTMvgciMnIcpzwpO_QSth3WE-f2GOob1U7ZUoTFV5WdnuvRSqWIuwKRM-M9VHl1nrA84xvcMGwpltFcsOivncuN2pIxXZGB2_tMl8DEt_neuVQwlk.xKY4sWe6yHfle7MfoKDLiPkYCJ8aWMVUqzDalfq9g8w&dib_tag=se&keywords=full+house+gould&qid=1736800489&sprefix=full+house+gould%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-1). Gould was one of the most impacful scientists and scientific communicators of his era. 


## Eck Sports Lab

My [sports website](https://ecklab.github.io/) provides descriptions of the baseball projects that I am actively working on. My main sports interest is the continual development of era-adjusted baseball statistics which balance how one performs vs their direct peers and the quality of the talent pool. Our work is inspired by Stephen Jay Gould's ideas.
